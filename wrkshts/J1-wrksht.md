# Worksheet: J1

Worksheets are self-guided activities that reinforce lectures. They are due Thursdays the week they are assigned.

Create a new repo using all the steps in Lab 0 called `yourgitusername-worksheet-J1`. 

Please submit your answers to the questions as comments in the `DriverJava1_sample.java` file you'll be writing in this lab, which you should add to your repo.


## Questions


### q

What is fault localization?


#### s
Fault localization typically involves tracing back from the line of code producing the incorrect output to where the problem actually was. To do this, a failing test case is needed, as well as the ability to trace through code, whether with print statements or a debugger.

### q

What are three benefits of Test Driven Development (TDD)?

#### s
* Your tests are not biased by your code
* Writing tests helps you think about how you might write code
* Writing tests helps you think about the requirements of your system

### q

Given the example of requirements for generating a password:

*    It must have at least one number.
*    It must have at least one uppercase letter.
*    It must have at least one lowercase letter.
*    It must not contain the website gmail anywhere. (For example if we were generating a password for gmail accounts)
*    It can only be made up of letters, numbers, and the underscore.

What are the input domain paritions for this exercise?

#### s

First, we have valid and invalid passwords:
* invalid
* valid

But each of these groups can be refined as:
* invalid
*   - missing uppercase letter
*   - missing lowercase letter
*   - missing number
*      - missing all combinations of the three items above
*   - contains `gmail`
*   - contains non-valid characters
* valid

Although the question did not ask for this, more tests could/should be generated by looking at the edge cases between these partitions.

### q

Complete the truth table below to show what inputs we need to achieve *active clause coverage* for the following conditional:

```java
if ( ( (a > b) or G ) and (x < y) )
```

| a > b | G | x < y | predicate outcome | clause responsible |

#### s

| a > b | G | x < y | predicate outcome | clause responsible |
|   T   | T |   T   | T                 | x < y              |
|   T   | T |   F   | F                 | x < y              |
|   F   | T |   T   | T                 | G                  |
|   F   | F |   T   | F                 | G                  |
|   T   | F |   T   | T                 | a > b              |
|   F   | F |   T   | F                 | a > b              |


### q

Consider the control flow graph below. What are all the paths (using node numbers) that would achieve full path coverage as a test criteria? Is this a finite set?

![flow](./flow_graph.png)

#### s

The set is infinite because of the loop between 3 and 4:

`
12567
1257
13567
1357
1343567
134357
13434567
1343457
134..567
134..67
`

### q

What benefit does *mutation testing* offer over other testing methods discussed in class?

#### s

Mutation testing is automated, in the sense that it solves the *oracle problem*: there is no need to define expected outputs, because we assume the current functionality of the program under test is correct (and therefore the correct output). Our goal is not to test the correctness of this code directly, but to test how complete/effective our test suite is. The assumption is that real bugs will be found in the code if we generate a robust enough test suite.

### q

In addition to github, you will be using a submitserver this semester to submit your labs and projects. First, you need to create an account for this server. 

Using the pinned post on Ed, go to this semester's submitserver URL and **click on the link to reset your password**. There, use your **@gwu.edu** email account (so NOT @gwmail.gwu.edu), and a password of your own choosing (that you need to remember) to create a new account. Check your inbox for an activation link. If you're not getting an activation link after a minute or so, reach out to the instruction staff ASAP so we can help you get an account.

You will be checking your submitserver setup on the next question.

Make sure you get a perfect score on the question below when you submit it to the submitserver to check your setup.

#### s

Make sure you get a perfect score on the question below when you submit it to the submitserver to check your setup.

### q

Finish the in-class exercise for finding the fault in the `checkCode` method.

#### s
Solution omitted.
